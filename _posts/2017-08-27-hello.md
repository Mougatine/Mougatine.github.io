title:  Hello World!

Hello! My name is Arthur Douillard, aka *Mougatine*.

I have decided to write this blog for several reasons:

*   To write about what I have just learned, and to try to correctly express
    my knowledge of it. See it as *flashcards*.

*   To improve my technical writing.

*   And I am still looking for a third reason; always aim for three items in a
    list!

*   The following article motivated me to write a blog:
    "[you should write blogs](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs)"

Thus, I do not have the pretention to write enlightening blog posts, but I would
be glad if you find it interesting.
