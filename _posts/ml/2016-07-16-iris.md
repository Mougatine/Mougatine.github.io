# Preambule

I began learning ML seriously a few weeks ago, and I've decided to publish as often as possible articles about how I'm playing with the Dataset I encounter.

The key to understand something is to be able to explain it to others, I hope this serie of articles will help me reach that goal.

I'll mainly use R language & Python.

# The Iris Dataset

You can find the iris dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).
It contains several informations (petal width & length, sepal width & length, species) about 150 flowers.

The goal for this exercice is to correctly be able to classify those flower with the help of your favorite gardener.

## Getting an idea of the dataset

Let's look the first row of Iris:

{% highlight r %}
> head(iris)
  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa
{% endhighlight %}

We want to know with features of the flowers are the most important its classification. We are going to plot as the different combinaisons to see if we can have a clear look on the three different species.

{% highlight r %}
pairs(iris[1:4], main="Iris Dataset", col=c("red", "green", "blue")[iris$Species])
{% endhighlight %}

Each color is associated to a species.

By giving a look on those plots we can see that both petal length & petal width seem to matter a lot for classification.

Closer look on the plot with petal length & width:


{% highlight r %}
> plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width, main = "Iris Dataset", col = c("red", "green", "blue")[iris$Species])
{% endhighlight %}

![Iris Dataset](/public/img/iris-dataset-1.jpeg)

The three different species are here very distinguable.

## Clustering

How the world is not perfect, and not all data in the world is already labeled for you. We are going to clusterize the flowers.

First we remove the species of our dataset (we are not suppose to know them !):

{% highlight r %}
> samples <- iris[-5]
> species     <- iris$species
{% endhighlight %}

Then we clusterize the flowers using [kmeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). We expect 3 clusters, therefore the *centers* option will be set to *3*. In real life situation we would have to guess to looking at the data and doing trial & error.

{% highlight r %}
> km <- kmeans(samples, centers = 3)
> plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width, col = km$cluster)
{% endhighlight %}

![Iris Dataset](/public/img/iris-dataset-2.jpeg)

The plot above has be colorized with the clusters produced by kmeans. Very similar with the one created the species labels isn't it ?
