      <description>Ball Lightning is an early book of Cixin Liu, the Three-Body Problem trilogy author. While not as good as its trilogy, the book was interesting to read because of its theme: Science.
The protagonists try to understand the ball lightning (a real phenomenon). The whole book is structured around their experiments, their thoughts, and failures. The end of the book goes a bit far, and is clearly &amp;ldquo;science-fiction&amp;rdquo;, but still in a &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo;, plausible way.</description>

      <description>Very Short Introduction (VSI) is an Oxford collection about various subjects, ranging from humanities (arts, religion, politics, etc.) to very technical field (neuroscience, physics, etc.). With a small format (~100 pages), they aim to be a good introduction.
VSI: Food fulfills perfectly this mission. The book is simple enough for a neophyte in food to understand, and still manages to cover a wide breadth of topics, all centered around food. It&amp;rsquo;s far easier than its cousin VSI: Nutrition.</description>
